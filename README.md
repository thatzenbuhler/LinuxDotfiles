# LinuxDotfiles
This repository contains the relevant configuration files for my persnal Linux applicaitons/distributions. Specifically, the current configuration is designed to be used on a Thinkpad x220 running Arch Linux, but the config files should work for any version of Linux given the proper applications are installed.

## Applications that use these config files

+ Arch Linux (Distribution) (New from Void)
+ i3 (i3-gaps)
+ urxvt
+ vim + NERDTree / Pathogen
+ zsh 
+ ranger
+ neofetch
+ compton (for transparency)
+ w3m / w3mimg for image previews
+ nm-applet / Network Manager
+ acpi (For battery info)
+ polybar
+ Hack console font
+ tmux
+ more I forgot
